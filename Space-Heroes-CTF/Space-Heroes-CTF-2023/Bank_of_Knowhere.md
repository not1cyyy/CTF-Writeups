# Description
Groot is in dire need of some crucial intel about the Bank of Knowhere, but they only share such classified information with their inner circle. In order to become a member of their inner circle, one must have at least 2000â‚³ - Units in their bank account. Can you lend a hand to Groot in acquiring this information? Remember, as Peter Quill once said, "We're the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy, we're supposed to protect the galaxy, not destroy it!"

# Solution
## Recon
- First we head to the link and we're greeted with this webpage :

- The source code has nothing interesting as it's just HTML

- Navigating to http://knowhere.hackers.best:31337/robots.txt, we see this :

- Interesting! now if we navigate to http://knowhere.hackers.best:31337/admin.php we see this :

## Trial and error

- This challenge slapped me in the face and then threw me with all my pentesting knowledge out of the window, I completely failed this challenge x)

- My initial plan was to intercept the request using Burpsuite and change some parameter, I went ahead and did exactly that :

- But then I was quickly slapped in the face with this response :

- Welp, that was aweful ^^', let's try to URL encode the receiver or add a null byte :

- It didn't quite like it...

- I literally ran out of ideas for like a whole day, then tried something that seemed to be stupid at first, but I quickly recognized the vulnerability as parameter injection!

# Execution 

- The solution was to add another receiver to the parameters, as the server checks for the first valid match only, we can add "Groot" as our second receiver :

- Now if we check, we see that "Groot" has more than 2000 units :
